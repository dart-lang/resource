/// A [Resource] is data that can be read into a Dart program.
///
/// A resource is identified by a URI. It can be loaded as bytes or data.
/// The resource URI may be a `package:` URI.
///
/// Example:
///
///     var resource = new Resource("package:foo/foo_data.txt");
///     var string = await resource.readAsString(UTF8);
///     print(string);
///
/// Example:
///
///     var resource = new Resource("http://example.com/data.json");
///     var obj = await resource.openRead()   // Reads as stream of bytes.
///                             .transform(UTF8.fuse(JSON).decoder)
///                             .first;
///
///
/// Notice: Currently this library requires `dart:io` to do the reading,
/// so it doesn't work in the browser. Use `browser_resource.dart` in the
/// browser.
